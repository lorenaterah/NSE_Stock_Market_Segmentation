    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) seeing a surge in equity turnover-rising 18% to Ksh 56 billion in 2025 ([SE Half-Year Results, 2025](https://www.nse.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/NSE-Plc-Unaudited-Group-results-for-the-6-months-ended-30-June-2025.pdf)), retail participation remains hampered by a critical information gap. Research from the Institute of Certified Investment and Financial Analysts reveals that 77% of Kenyan retail investors rely on \"personal research\" and social intuition because they lack accessible analytical tools [ICIFA Annual Report, 2024](https://icifa.co.ke/static/resources/others/annual-report-2024465e3dbed42d.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the market added over Ksh 1 Trillion in capitalization since 2023, most investors suffer from \"herding behavior,\" where decisions are made by following the crowd rather than technical data [USIU-Africa Research, 2025](https://erepo.usiu.ac.ke/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11732/8460/MASILA%20BRIAN%20SALU%20MBA%202024.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). This project bridges this gap by converting raw daily prices into behavioral risk clusters, moving investors from intuition to evidence-based decision-making."

    "- To develop a data-driven stock market intelligence system for the Nairobi Securities Exchange that analyzes historical stock price behavior and sector characteristics to support informed and risk-aware investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific Objectives**\n",
    "1) Feature Engineering: To derive financial metrics including Rolling Volatility, Daily Returns, and Maximum Drawdowns to quantify stock behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Behavioral Segmentation: To apply Unsupervised Machine Learning (K-Means/DBSCAN) to group stocks into risk-based clusters (e.g., Stable, High-Volatility, or Speculative).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Sector Risk Analysis: To identify systemic risks and stability patterns across different market sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Interactive Deployment: To present these insights through a Streamlit Dashboard that allows users to select stocks, view their risk profile, and compare them against their sectors."
