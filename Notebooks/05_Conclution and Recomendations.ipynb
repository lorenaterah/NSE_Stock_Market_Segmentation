    "This project tackled a common problem: most ordinary investors in the Nairobi Securities Exchange; lack the tools and information needed to make smart investment decisions. To fix this, we coverted raw historical stock price data into clear, useful risk indicators including how much a stock's price fluctuates, its daily returns, and how badly it has dropped in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning was then used to group NSE stocks by behavior, separating them into low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk categories. This removes guesswork and gives investors an objective way to compare stocks. The analysis also looked at patterns across different sectors, revealing which industries tend to be stable and which are more volatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this was packaged into an easy to use interactive dashboard built using streamlit, so that investors can explore stocks, compare them, and understand their risk level without needing a finance degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a practical, data-driven tool that helps everyday investors make better decisions moving away from following the crowd and toward evidence based investing in Kenya's stock market."

    "1. Build a Simple Investor App - Create a website or mobile app where any investor can search for an NSE stock and immediately see how risky it is and how it has been performing. Keep it simple enough that someone with no finance background can use it comfortably.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Teach Investors How to Use Risk Profiles - Hold workshops and create short videos and simple graphics that explain what the different risk categories mean and how investors can use them to pick better stocks and manage their money wisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Help Investors Spread Their Risk - Show investors how to avoid putting all their money in one place by choosing stocks from different risk groups. A careful investor should lean toward low-risk stocks, while a bold investor can consider higher-risk ones — as long as they understand what that means.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Encourage Data-Based Decisions - Push investors to stop following the crowd and instead look at real numbers. The app should clearly show key indicators that measure actual stock performance and explain what those numbers mean in everyday language.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Show Which Sectors Are Risky - Give investors a clear picture of which industries tend to be more volatile. This helps them avoid putting too much money into one risky sector without realizing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Keep the Tool Up to Date - Regularly update the system with fresh market data and new information so that the risk profiles stay accurate and useful over time."
