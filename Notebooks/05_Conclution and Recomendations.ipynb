    "This project tackled a common problem: most ordinary investors in the Nairobi Securities Exchange; lack the tools and information needed to make smart investment decisions. To fix this, we coverted raw historical stock price data into clear, useful risk indicators including how much a stock's price fluctuates, its daily returns, and how badly it has dropped in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning was then used to group NSE stocks by behavior, separating them into low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk categories. This removes guesswork and gives investors an objective way to compare stocks. The analysis also looked at patterns across different sectors, revealing which industries tend to be stable and which are more volatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this was packaged into an easy to use interactive dashboard built using streamlit, so that investors can explore stocks, compare them, and understand their risk level without needing a finance degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a practical, data-driven tool that helps everyday investors make better decisions moving away from following the crowd and toward evidence based investing in Kenya's stock market."
